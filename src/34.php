$sum = $num1 + $num2;
echo "The sum is: $sum";

// Calculate the difference
$difference = $num1 - $num2;
echo "The difference is: $difference";

// Calculate the product
$product = $num1 * $num2;
echo "The product is: $product";

// Calculate the quotient
$quotient = $num1 / $num2;
echo "The quotient is: $quotient";
